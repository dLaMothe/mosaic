To run the program you can build using the command

go build

within the mosaic directory

This will generate an executable mosaic which you can use to a local server
by running

./mosaic

Now that the program is hosted you can test it out by loading accessing this
url in a browser

http://localhost:8080/

From this point you simply have to add a tag description for the photos 
and then upload a photo to be turned into a mosaic
